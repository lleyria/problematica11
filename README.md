Version 1.0.1 Code and samples of the html structure, js logic and css style of the eleventh "Problematica Semanal" from the Radium Rocket's Become a software developer course. In this exercise I recreate a the front-end of one of the entities from our caldAR project using a javascript library called React. I take the entity called Buildings. First i created a mocked database of buildings to manipulate then manage to construct a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions to the list prevously inserted. At the end, y focused on adding a headear and style to this page. One of the determinate things in which I focused was the internalization of the so called "Buenas Pr√°cticas". These good practices suchs as proxily, coherence and adaptability are not strictly requiered to be a programer but neccesary to be a good programer and make individual and group, work more efficient.
